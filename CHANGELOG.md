# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.6] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Energy flow sensors now update automatically with each coordinator refresh cycle (same interval as other sensors).

## [2.3.5] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Energy flow sensors now properly assigned to the inverter device (no more orphaned entities).

## [2.3.4] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Grid Down binary sensor — detects when the grid is unavailable (off-grid mode) and triggers automations.

## [2.3.3] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- Energy flow sensors from `queryDeviceEnergyFlow` endpoint: Battery SOC, Battery Power, PV Power, Grid Power, Load Power — these are the sensors needed for the power flow dashboard card.

## [2.3.2] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- Token refresh and authentication error recovery — integration now automatically re-authenticates when the token expires, preventing "disconnected" state after initial setup.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed
- API response validation: `queryDeviceOneDataxxx` returns `code: 0` without a `success` field, which was incorrectly treated as a failure.
- Added configurable `devaddr` parameter (default: `4`) — required because different devices use different addresses (e.g. `4` vs `255`).

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- **Migrated from DessMonitor API to ValueClouds API** - The integration now connects to `api.valueclouds.com` instead of `api.dessmonitor.com`. This is a complete rewrite of the API client.
- Authentication changed from GET with SHA-1 signatures to POST JSON login with token-based authentication.
- Configuration now requires **PN**, **SN**, and **devcode** values (obtained from browser DevTools on valueclouds.com) instead of email/password/company_key.
- Updated UI strings and manifest to reference "ValueClouds" instead of "DessMonitor".

### Notes
- The DOMAIN remains `dessmonitor` for backward compatibility with existing configs.
- ValueClouds API v1 only supports read-only data - remote control entities (select/number) are not available in this version.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- Test suite: introduced a `pytest` suite under `tests/` running against a real Home Assistant core via `pytest-homeassistant-custom-component` (pinned in `requirements_test.txt`, configured in `pyproject.toml`). Covers the config-flow update-interval coercion (#29) and the number-entity slider range/step logic (#22/#23), with the latter at 100% line coverage. Run with `make test` / `make test-cov`; `make install` now also installs the test dependencies.
- CLI: `analyze` output now captures `hint` (e.g. `"48.0~56.0V"`) and `unit` for value-type control fields, so contributors debugging number-entity range issues have the API-provided min/max available directly in the analysis JSON. Bumped `analysis_version` to 3; existing v2 analyses still verify against their own checksum (#22, thanks to @arasuludag for the detailed bug report that exposed the gap).

### Fixed
- Charging-voltage and current number entities now stay usable when the DessMonitor API sends a wrong or missing `hint`. The slider range used to come straight from the hint, so a bad hint (e.g. `25-30V` reported on a 48V system whose live setting is `57.6V`) or a missing hint (HA defaulting to `0-100`) left the slider unusable and rejected valid `number.set_value` calls as "out of range". The range is now trusted only when the hint actually brackets the device's current value; otherwise it is synthesized around the live value (floored at `0` for V/A, generous headroom). Since the API rejects genuinely invalid writes, erring wide is safe. The range logic moved to a dependency-free `number_range.py` helper (#22, thanks to @arasuludag for confirming the API returns the wrong hint and @albertdb for the 12V data point and the "API rejects invalid writes anyway" insight; also resolves the range half of #23 reported by @Dymyk).
- Unloading a config entry no longer raises `KeyError` if the coordinator was never stored (e.g. when setup failed partway): `async_unload_entry` now pops from `hass.data` defensively and only closes the API session when a coordinator is present.
- Config flow: selecting an update interval no longer fails with `value must be one of [60, 300, 600, 1800, 3600]` on submit. The interval dropdown is backed by an integer-keyed `vol.In`, but the frontend returns the chosen value as a string, so validation rejected every selection and the integration could not be added. The schema now coerces the value to `int` before the membership check (`vol.All(vol.Coerce(int), vol.In(...))`) in both the initial setup and the options flow, mirroring Home Assistant core's own idiom (#29, thanks to @Obibokhomie for the detailed report and root-cause analysis, and to @mullerpetr76 and @Rybriz for confirming).
- Voltage and current number entities (e.g. bulk/floating charging voltage, max charging current) now get a `0.1` step even when the DessMonitor API omits the `hint` field for that control. Previously the step was only set when a hint was present, so hint-less fields fell back to Home Assistant's default step of `1`, making the slider too coarse for voltage adjustments (#23, thanks to @Dymyk for the screenshot showing the entity attributes).

## [2.1.0] - 2026-04-20

### Added
- Support for devcode 2507 (ANENJI ANJ-6200W-48PL-WIFI) with sensor title mappings for Battery SOC, energy totals, and temperature titles with API typos and double spaces. Operating mode normalisation fixes the "Grid mode" value so the Operating Mode sensor is available, and output/charger priority mappings cover the short codes returned by the collector (#21, thanks to @algrishina for the CLI analysis data).

### Fixed
- devcode 2452 (Axpert PI18): duplicate `Energy Today` / `Energy Total` entities caused by the summary endpoint (`webQueryDeviceEs`) returning `energyToday`/`energyTotal` alongside the lastData-sourced `Today/Total generation`; both are now mapped to the canonical names so the coordinator's summary-dedup logic skips them (#17, thanks to @DastardlyBaker for the HA screenshots and analysis data).
- devcode 2452 (Axpert PI18): `Energy Today`, `Energy Month`, and `Energy Year` values were inflated ~1000x because `queryDeviceLastData` reports these counters in Wh while the sensor unit is fixed to kWh; values are now scaled to kWh. `Total generation` is already reported in kWh and is left unchanged (#17).

### Changed
- Documentation: added a contributor guide in `custom_components/dessmonitor/device_support/README.md` covering the end-to-end devcode onboarding workflow (CLI analysis, mapping file layout, registry registration, and changelog conventions) so new devcode contributions can be prepared without reading the existing devcode files as examples.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- **Device configuration control** - Read and write inverter settings directly from Home Assistant (#16, #18). All controllable fields are dynamically discovered from the DessMonitor API per device:
  - **Select entities** for settings with predefined options (Output Priority, Charger Source Priority, Battery Type, Buzzer Mode, Output Voltage/Frequency, Boot Method, and more).
  - **Number entities** for numeric settings with min/max ranges parsed from the API hint field (charging voltages, max currents, SOC protection values, EQ timers).
  - **Button entities** for single-action commands (Clear Record, Reset User Settings, Forced EQ Charging, Exit Fault Mode) - dynamically detected from API fields with exactly one option.
  - Current values are read from all devices in parallel at startup via `queryDeviceCtrlValue` and cached. Writes update the cache optimistically.
- Support for devcode 2452 (Axpert PI18 protocol, rebranded) with sensor mappings, output/charger priority normalization, and dual PV input / second AC output support (#17, thanks to @DastardlyBaker for the CLI analysis data).
- Support for devcode 2428 (Hybrid inverter) with sensor title mappings for output power/voltage/frequency, battery capacity to State of Charge, PV charging current/voltage, and load percent (#20, thanks to @KIBkz for the CLI analysis data).
- New sensor definitions: Energy Month, Energy Year, Second Output Frequency, Second Output Voltage.
- CLI: analysis output now includes `analysis_version` field (v2) and HMAC-SHA256 `checksum` for integrity verification. Device serial number is excluded from the checksum so users can redact it without breaking validation.
- CLI: new `verify` command to validate analysis JSON files against their checksum.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Support for devcode 6515 (ANENJI ANJ-HHS-11KW-48V-WIFI) with sensor mappings, operating mode normalization, and PV temperature support (#13, thanks to @dekov3 for the CLI analysis data).
- Support for devcode 6544 (ANENJI ANJ-HHS-11KW-48V) with sensor mappings, operating mode normalization, and split-phase output support (#11, thanks to @blihtar for the CLI analysis data).

### Fixed
- Fetch "Battery percentage" (SOC) from the parameters API endpoint for devcode 2376, since this sensor only exists in `queryDeviceParsEs` and not in `queryDeviceLastData`. The coordinator now fetches parameters in parallel when a devcode declares `parameter_sensor_names`, merges them with dedup into the device data, and the existing title mapping produces the State of Charge entity (#12, thanks to @baziliolg for reporting and providing analysis data).
- Graceful per-device error handling: a single device returning `ERR_NO_RECORD` (API error 12) no longer blocks all other devices from loading. Failed devices are skipped with a warning log, and `UpdateFailed` is only raised when every collector fails.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- Support for devcode 2334 (EASUN 6.2KW Hybrid Solar Inverter) with sensor mappings and priority normalization (#8, thanks to @AndyTempleman for the CLI analysis data).
- Support for devcode 2449 (EASUN 8/11KWA, WKS Evo MAX II 10kVA 48V) with sensor mappings, priority normalization, and operating mode handling (#6, thanks to @TheJudge01 and @mielune for the CLI analysis data).
- New sensor definitions: Battery Charging Current, Battery Discharge Current, State of Charge, Output Frequency, Energy Today, Energy Total.

### Fixed
- Standardized sensor title casing across all devcode files (Output Frequency, State of Charge, Energy Today/Total now have proper SENSOR_TYPES metadata).
- Resolved mypy type errors in data coordinator for devcode type narrowing.

## [1.7.0] - 2025-12-11

### Added
- Support for devcode 2451 (Axpert MKS IV 5600VA) with sensor mappings and priority normalization (#5, thanks to @FifoTheHein for the CLI analysis data).

### Fixed
- Treat placeholder string values (e.g., "-"/"n/a") as unavailable so HA numeric sensors don't raise errors when PV readings are missing.
- Deduplicate summary energy sensors by mapping titles, preventing duplicate Energy Today/Total entities when summary data overlaps with device data.
- Lower duplicate sensor log level to DEBUG to reduce noise when duplicate titles are safely skipped.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- Documented the `known_inverters` metadata field across device support docs/templates so contributors can record which inverter models have been validated per devcode.
- Device support for devcode 2361 (SRNE SR-EOV24-3.5K-5KWh) with sensor mappings and operating mode normalization (thanks to @pjJedi for the CLI analysis data).
- Additional sensor definitions (inverter current, load apparent power, PV/inverter radiator temperatures, battery energy charge/discharge counters, accumulated mains load energy, daily/total battery amp-hours, etc.) so devcode-specific mappings can surface the extended telemetry in Home Assistant.
- CLI `analyze` command now pulls control-field metadata and live parameter values so contributors can map diagnostics/configuration sensors without manually querying the API.

### Changed
- README device-support section now explicitly lists the confirmed inverter pairing for devcodes 2376 (POW-HVM6.2K-48V-LIP) and 6422 (Must PH19-6048 EXP) and clarifies how the generic fallback behaves.
- DessMonitor API and config flow now mask usernames, passwords, and tokens in logs and drop unused RC4 helper to avoid leaking sensitive data.
- Sensor setup now applies devcode transformations before filtering supported types, preventing SRNE/POW-HVM data from being dropped when titles differ from the canonical names.

### Fixed
- devcode 2361 operating mode mapping now handles the "Inverter Operation" string reported by SRNE SR-EOV24 collectors so the mode appears in Home Assistant (#3).
- Battery Energy Total (Charge/Discharge) sensors use the `measurement` state class to avoid Home Assistant Recorder warnings when devices report occasional counter decreases (#3).

## [1.5.0] - 2025-11-09

### Added
- Support for DessMonitor devcode 6422 used by Must PH19-6048 EXP collectors, including operating-mode normalization (thanks to @tosstosstoss for providing analysis data)
- New sensor definitions (SOC, PV string voltages/currents, accumulated energy counters, radiator temperatures, charger enable state, etc.) so the additional metrics surface in Home Assistant

### Changed
- Improved DessMonitor API error logging with detailed HTTP status and response diagnostics for easier troubleshooting of 500 errors.
- Added Git/GitHub workflow guide covering branching, tagging, and release process.
