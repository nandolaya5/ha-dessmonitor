A Home Assistant integration for monitoring solar inverters via DessMonitor/SmartESS platform with periodic updates (5-minute default; 1-minute with Detailed Data Collection Acceleration).

> **Also known as:** SmartESS, WatchPower, Energy-Mate, Fronus Solar, or other Eybond cloud-based monitoring platforms. This integration works with any inverter system that reports to the DessMonitor web platform (www.dessmonitor.com).

## 🧰 Supported Inverter Brands

DessMonitor/SmartESS data collectors are typically installed alongside inverter systems from a variety of brands. This integration targets the DessMonitor backend and therefore works across many rebrands/OEM models that use the same platform.

- PowMr
- EASUN Power
- MPP Solar
- MUST Power
- Voltronic Power “Axpert” rebrands (various regional labels)
- Fronus Solar

Notes:
- This is a non-exhaustive list. Many Axpert/Voltronic-derived models and regional rebrands work when connected via a DessMonitor/SmartESS data collector.
- If your installer provided SmartESS or DessMonitor app access, or your system uses WatchPower/Energy‑Mate and logs into dessmonitor.com, it’s very likely supported.
- Don’t see your brand? If it reports to https://www.dessmonitor.com/ with a collector on your account, it should work. Open an issue with your device details if unsure.
